# Consultation Chamber — Soft Polling
# Poll the WHAT. Consult the HOW. Dictate the DETAILS.

version: "1.0.0"

description: |
  The Consultation Chamber manages community input without design-by-committee.
  
  THE SPECTRUM:
  - STRATEGIC (Polled): Major features, skills, regions
  - DIRECTION (Consulted): Visual style A vs B, tone choices
  - EXECUTION (Dictated): Specific details, pixel-level decisions
  
  After direction is decided, execution is LOCKED.

  response: |
    That's a tactical execution detail.
    
    The strategic greenlight was: {greenlight_poll}
    Visual direction was consulted: {direction_decision}
    
    This specific detail is a Taste Owner decision, not a poll.
    I won't surface sentiment on execution details.
