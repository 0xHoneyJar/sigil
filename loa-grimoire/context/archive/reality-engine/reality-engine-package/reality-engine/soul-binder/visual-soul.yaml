# Soul Binder — Visual Soul
# Cultural signatures that go beyond technical specifications.
# Technical compliance ≠ Soul.

version: "1.0.0"

description: |
  Visual soul captures the FEEL of assets, not just their specs.
  An asset can meet every polygon budget and texture constraint
  while still having the "Play-Doh" problem—too smooth, too clean.
  
  This file defines the cultural signatures that make assets feel right.

# THE MOD WEST PRINCIPLE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

mod_west_principle:
  description: |
    Named after an artist who creates authentic-feeling assets
    by studying the specific IMPERFECTIONS of original content.
    
    The key insight: The imperfections ARE the aesthetic.
    Perfect recreations feel wrong because they're too clean.
  
  characteristics:
    - name: "Slightly off-center textures"
      description: "Hand-placed, not procedurally centered"
    
    - name: "Hand-painted noise"
      description: "Visible brush strokes, not procedural noise"
    
    - name: "Color banding visibility"
      description: "Distinct color steps, not smooth gradients"
    
    - name: "Deliberate rough edges"
      description: "Edges that aren't perfectly anti-aliased"
    
    - name: "Asymmetric details"
      description: "Not perfectly mirrored or balanced"

mod_ghost_antipattern:
  description: |
    Named after an artist whose technically superior assets
    were culturally rejected by the community.
    
    The problem: Assets were too smooth, too high-fidelity,
    too "modern" for the product's identity.
  
  warning_signs:
    - name: "Smooth gradients"
      description: "Colors blend too smoothly"
      threshold: "gradient_smoothness > 0.7"

      description: "Anti-aliasing too clean"
      threshold: "edge_sharpness < 0.3"
    
    - name: "Procedural textures"
      description: "No hand-painted feel"
      threshold: "hand_painted_indicators < 0.5"

grit_signatures:
  
  description: |
    Measurable characteristics that indicate cultural fit.
    Assets are compared against these signatures.
  
  metrics:
    
    edge_roughness:
      description: "How rough/crisp the edges are"
      scale: "0.0 (perfectly smooth) to 1.0 (very rough)"
      minimum: 0.3
      ideal_range: [0.4, 0.7]
      measurement: |
        Analyze edge pixels for variance in anti-aliasing.
        Higher variance = more roughness = more character.
    
    color_band_visibility:
      description: "How distinct color steps are"
      scale: "0.0 (smooth gradient) to 1.0 (hard bands)"
      minimum: 0.5
      ideal_range: [0.5, 0.8]
      measurement: |
        Analyze color transitions for step vs gradient.
        Distinct steps = more old-school feel.
    
    texture_noise:
      description: "Amount of hand-painted noise/detail"
      scale: "0.0 (flat) to 1.0 (heavily textured)"
      minimum: 0.2
      ideal_range: [0.3, 0.6]
      measurement: |
        Analyze texture for non-procedural variation.
        Hand-painted indicators = authentic feel.
    
    silhouette_chunkiness:
      description: "How chunky/readable the silhouette is"
      scale: "0.0 (smooth/detailed) to 1.0 (blocky/iconic)"
      minimum: 0.4
      ideal_range: [0.5, 0.8]
      measurement: |
        Analyze silhouette at 50% scale.
        Should be identifiable in 3 seconds.
    
    detail_hierarchy:
      description: "Clear focal point vs uniform detail"
      scale: "0.0 (uniform) to 1.0 (clear hierarchy)"
      minimum: 0.5
      ideal_range: [0.6, 0.9]
      measurement: |
        Analyze attention distribution.
        One clear focal point = good hierarchy.

      - "Simplify small details that don't read at distance"
      - "Make key shapes more distinct/blocky"
      - "Test readability at 50% scale"
  
  low_detail_hierarchy:
    issue: "No clear focal point"
    suggestions:
      - "Identify the most important element"
