# Sigil → Loa Handoff Template

> Generated when /craft encounters a STRUCTURAL issue that requires architecture-level changes.

---

## Handoff Record

**Generated:** {{timestamp}}
**From:** Sigil Apprentice Smith
**To:** Loa Architecture Agent
**Type:** STRUCTURAL_CHANGE

---

## Context

### Original Request

```
User Request: "{{user_request}}"
Component: {{component_path}}
Zone: {{zone_name}}
```

### Hammer Diagnosis

```
Classification: STRUCTURAL
Reason: {{diagnosis_reason}}
```

---

## Physics Constraint

The request violates or requires changing fundamental physics:

| Constraint | Current | Requested | Impact |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| {{constraint_name}} | {{current_value}} | {{requested_value}} | {{impact}} |

---

## Why This Can't Be Done in Sigil

Sigil operates within the physics layer. This request requires changes to:

- [ ] Zone sync authority (server_authoritative ↔ client_authoritative)
- [ ] Tick mode (discrete ↔ continuous)
- [ ] Material assignment (clay/machinery/glass)
- [ ] Budget limits (interactive_elements, decisions, animations)
- [ ] Fidelity ceiling (Gold Standard constraints)

These are **architectural decisions**, not UI decisions.

---

## Proposed Changes

### Option A: Change Zone Physics

```yaml
# Current: sigil-mark/resonance/zones.yaml
{{zone_name}}:
  physics:
    sync: {{current_sync}}
    tick: {{current_tick}}

# Proposed:
{{zone_name}}:
  physics:
    sync: {{proposed_sync}}
    tick: {{proposed_tick}}
```

**Impact:**
- {{impact_item_1}}
- {{impact_item_2}}

### Option B: Create Exception Zone

```yaml
# New zone for this component
{{new_zone_name}}:
  paths: ["{{component_path}}"]
  physics:
    sync: {{proposed_sync}}
    tick: {{proposed_tick}}
```

**Impact:**
- Isolated change, only affects this component
- May create zone proliferation

### Option C: Taste Key Override

Request a ruling from the Taste Key holder:
```
/approve --override {{constraint_name}} --scope "{{component_path}}"
```

**Impact:**
- Temporary exception, not architectural change
- Must be reviewed periodically by /garden

---

## Loa Consultation Required

This handoff requires a `/consult` decision:

```
/consult "Should {{zone_name}} allow {{requested_change}}?"
```

### Consultation Parameters

```yaml
question: "Should {{zone_name}} allow {{requested_change}}?"
context:
  current_physics: {{current_value}}
  requested_change: {{requested_value}}
  affected_components:
    - {{component_path}}
impact:
  trust_model: {{trust_impact}}
  data_integrity: {{data_integrity_impact}}
  user_experience: {{ux_impact}}
```

---

## Sigil Cannot Proceed Until

1. Loa architectural decision is made, OR
2. Taste Key override is granted, OR
3. User accepts current physics as designed

---

## Return Path

After Loa decision:
- If zones.yaml changes → Run `/craft` again with new physics
- If override granted → Run `/craft` with `--override` flag
- If rejected → Explain physics to user, suggest alternatives
