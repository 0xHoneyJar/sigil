# Sigil v3.0 — Personas
# User archetypes with physics and constraints
#
# Philosophy: "Same feature, different truth. Not simplified - just appropriate."
#
# TERMINOLOGY (v3.0):
# - "Persona" = User archetype (power_user, newcomer, mobile, accessibility)
# - "Lens" = UI rendering variant (DefaultLens, StrictLens, A11yLens)
# - Do NOT confuse these terms.
#
# Each persona represents a different user's reality:
# - power_user (Chef): Keyboard-driven, efficiency-focused
# - newcomer (Henlocker): Guided, forgiving, educational
# - mobile (Thumbzone): Touch-optimized, gesture-aware
# - accessibility (A11y): Screen-reader first, high contrast
