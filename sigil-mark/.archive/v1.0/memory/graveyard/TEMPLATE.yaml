  reason: |
    Why this was archived.
    Example: "Superseded by MUT-2026-004 which uses different approach"
    Example: "Experiment failed - user testing showed no improvement"
    Example: "Ruling no longer needed - file was refactored"

  outcome: ""                # success | failure | superseded | obsolete

  lessons_learned: |
    What we learned from this experiment.
    Example: "Users prefer explicit confirmation over speed"

# GRAVEYARD PURPOSE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The graveyard serves as institutional memory:
#
# 1. HISTORICAL RECORD
#    - What was tried and why
#    - What worked and what didn't
#    - Context that led to decisions
#
# 2. PREVENT REPEATING MISTAKES
#    - "We tried this in Era 1, here's why it failed"
#    - /garden checks for similar patterns before approving
#
# 3. ENABLE REVISITING
#    - Conditions may have changed
#    - What failed in Era 1 might work in Era 2
#    - Cooldown periods prevent immediate retry
#
# Commands:
# - /garden archive ID       # Move item to graveyard
# - /garden history [query]  # Search graveyard
