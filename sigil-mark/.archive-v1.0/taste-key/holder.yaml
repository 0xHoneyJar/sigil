  authority:
    absolute:
      # Things the Taste Key holder has ABSOLUTE authority over
      # No committee, no vote, their word is final
      - "Visual execution (colors, typography, spacing)"
      - "Animation timing and easing"
      - "Material selection for components"
      - "Budget overrides with justification"
      - "Fidelity ceiling overrides with justification"

      - "Lens configuration"

    cannot_override:
      # Things even the Taste Key holder cannot change
      # These are physics, not taste
      - "Core physics (sync authority, tick modes)"
      - "Greenlighted concepts (only /greenlight can approve)"

        Concept approval BEFORE building.
        "Should we build this?" is separate from "How should it look?"

      flow:
        1: "Concept proposed"
        2: "Taste Key reviews concept (not execution)"
        3: "Greenlight = permission to build"
        4: "Execution decisions come later"

    execution:
      description: |
        Visual execution DURING building.
        The Taste Key holder dictates the "how."

      flow:
        1: "Developer implements with physics constraints"
        2: "Taste Key reviews execution"
        3: "Taste Key approves OR requests changes"
        4: "Changes are specific ('change to 8px' not 'make it better')"

    integrity:
      description: |
        Post-ship integrity checks.
        Ensure shipped product matches approved execution.

        1: "/garden detects drift"
        2: "Taste Key reviews drift"
        3: "Approve evolution OR request correction"

  # PHILOSOPHY
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  philosophy:
    core_belief: |
      Design is not democratic. Great products have a singular vision.
      The Taste Key holder IS that vision for visual execution.

    linear_quote: |
      "Individuals with taste, not committees with checklists."
      — Linear design philosophy

    osrs_quote: |
      "Poll concepts, dictate execution."
      — OSRS governance model

    responsibility: |
      With absolute authority comes absolute responsibility.
      The Taste Key holder owns the visual success or failure.
      They cannot blame the team; the team follows their direction.

      What happens when the Taste Key holder changes.

    rules:
      - rule: "Only one holder at a time"
        reason: "Split authority creates inconsistency"

      - rule: "Handoff requires documentation"
        reason: "New holder must understand current truths"

      - rule: "Era transition recommended"
        reason: "New holder likely brings new perspective"

      - rule: "Rulings remain valid until reviewed"
        reason: "Stability during transition"

    handoff_checklist:
      - "Document current era truths"
      - "Review active mutations"
      - "Brief on key moments and anti-patterns"
      - "Transfer access to rulings directory"
      - "Announce transition to team"
