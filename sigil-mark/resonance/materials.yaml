  philosophy:
    insight: |
      Materials define HOW something feels, not HOW it looks.
      The same button can be Clay or Glass depending on context.

      Airbnb's DLS taught us: materials have physics properties.
      - Light behavior (diffuse, flat, refract)
      - Weight (heavy, none, weightless)
      - Motion (spring, instant, ease)
      - Feedback (depress, highlight, glow)

    principle: |
      Choose material by ACTION TYPE, not visual preference.
      The user feels the difference before they see it.

  # MATERIAL DEFINITIONS
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  definitions:
    clay:
      id: "clay"
      name: "Clay"
      description: "Heavy, tactile, trustworthy"

      physics:
        light: "diffuse"
        weight: "heavy"
        motion:
          type: "spring"
          stiffness: 120
          damping: 14
        feedback: "depress"

      css_implications:
        background: "Solid colors, subtle gradients"
        shadow: "Soft, diffuse shadows (ambient + key)"
        border: "Subtle borders or none"
        transform: "scale(0.98) on press"
        transition: "Spring physics via cubic-bezier or motion library"

      zone_affinity:
        - critical
        - financial
        - celebration

      feel: |
        Clay elements feel HEAVY.
        When you press them, they sink slightly.
        When they spring back, there's momentum.
        The delay communicates: "This matters."

      examples:
        - "Claim button in critical zone"
        - "Confirm transaction button"
        - "Submit form in financial context"

    machinery:
      id: "machinery"
      name: "Machinery"
      description: "Efficient, precise, invisible"

      physics:
        light: "flat"
        weight: "none"
        motion:
          type: "instant"
          duration_ms: 0
        feedback: "highlight"

      css_implications:
        background: "Flat colors, no gradients"
        shadow: "None or minimal"
        border: "Crisp, functional borders"
        transform: "None (instant state change)"
        transition: "None or instant"

      zone_affinity:
        - transactional
        - admin
        - utility

      feel: |
        Machinery elements are INVISIBLE.
        They don't draw attention to themselves.
        Click and it's done. No ceremony.
        Efficiency is the priority.

      examples:
        - "Checkbox in settings"
        - "Pagination controls"
        - "Sort/filter buttons"
        - "Table row actions"

    glass:
      id: "glass"
      name: "Glass"
      description: "Light, delightful, magical"

      physics:
        light: "refract"
        weight: "weightless"
        motion:
          type: "ease"
          duration_ms: 200
          easing: "ease-out"
        feedback: "glow"

      css_implications:
        background: "Translucent, blur, gradients allowed"
        shadow: "Glow effects, colored shadows"
        border: "None or glass-morphism"
        transform: "Subtle lift on hover"
        transition: "Smooth ease-out transitions"

      zone_affinity:
        - exploratory
        - marketing
        - onboarding

      feel: |
        Glass elements feel MAGICAL.
        They float, they glow, they invite exploration.
        There's delight in interacting with them.
        Discovery should feel effortless.

      examples:
        - "Feature card in marketing"
        - "Onboarding tooltip"
        - "Gallery item hover"
        - "Promotional banner"

  # SELECTION GUIDE

  selection_guide:
    description: |
      Don't ask "What looks good?"
      Ask "What ACTION is this?"

    by_action_type:
      irreversible_actions:
        material: clay
        reason: "Weight communicates consequence"
        examples:
          - "Delete account"
          - "Send transaction"
          - "Claim reward"

      frequent_actions:
        material: machinery
        reason: "Efficiency reduces friction"
        examples:
          - "Toggle setting"
          - "Add to cart"
          - "Mark as read"

      exploratory_actions:
        material: glass
        reason: "Delight encourages discovery"
        examples:
          - "View details"
          - "Expand preview"
          - "Hover for info"

      mixed_context:
        description: |
          Some actions change material based on ZONE.
          A "Submit" button might be:
          - Clay in critical zone (transaction form)
          - Machinery in admin zone (filter form)
          - Glass in marketing zone (newsletter signup)

  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # AGENT RULES
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  agent_rules:
    before_generating: |
      1. Determine the ZONE from file path
      2. Check zone's material affinity
      3. Consider action type (irreversible, frequent, exploratory)
      4. Apply material's CSS implications

    on_button_creation: |
      Ask: "What happens when this is clicked?"
      - Creates/modifies important data → Clay
      - Performs routine operation → Machinery
      - Opens detail/preview → Glass

    on_card_creation: |
      Ask: "What is this card's purpose?"
      - Displays critical info requiring action → Clay
      - Shows data in admin/utility context → Machinery
      - Invites exploration or discovery → Glass

    on_material_conflict: |
      When zone affinity and action type disagree:
      1. Action type wins for primary interaction
      2. Zone affinity wins for container styling
      3. Document the decision in code comment
