# Moodboard Sandbox

> "Experiment freely. Curate deliberately."

This directory is **gitignored**. Drop anything here for local experimentation without affecting team taste.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Design spikes** | Exploring a new animation library |
| **Quick drops** | Screenshots for immediate reference |
| **Prototype assets** | Rough mockups before refinement |
| **External downloads** | Competitor screenshots, Dribbble saves |
| **Video captures** | Screen recordings, interaction demos |

## Workflow

```
1. Drop raw assets here freely
2. Experiment and iterate locally
3. When something proves valuable:
   → Curate to references/{source}/ with markdown
   → Add frontmatter for zone/material tagging
   → Delete the sandbox original
```

## What Belongs Here vs. Curated

| Sandbox (ignored) | Curated (tracked) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Raw screenshots | Markdown with analysis |
| Video clips | Key frames as optimized images |
| Competitor dumps | Synthesized learnings |
| Rough explorations | Proven patterns |
| Everything unprocessed | Optimized, tagged, documented |

## File Naming

Descriptive names help you find things later:
- `stripe-checkout-2026-01-10.png`
- `linear-keyboard-nav-demo.mov`
- `competitor-x-onboarding-flow/`

## Cleanup

Periodically review and either:
- **Promote**: Move valuable discoveries to curated folders
- **Delete**: Remove experiments that didn't pan out

This sandbox is yours. The team never sees it.
