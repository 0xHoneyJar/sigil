# Sigil Philosophy
# Version: 9.1.0

# Core principles that guide all design decisions.
# These are the "why" behind the physics and zones.

version: "9.1.0"

principles:
  - id: flow-state
    name: "Preserve Flow State"
    description: "Never interrupt the designer's creative flow"
    implications:
      - No auto-fix on save
      - Polish is deliberate, not automatic
      - Observe silently, interrupt rarely

  - id: invisible-infrastructure
    name: "Invisible Infrastructure"
    description: "Using it IS the experience"
    implications:
      - No governance dialogs
      - No approval workflows blocking creation
      - Infrastructure fades into the background

  - id: survival-over-ceremony
    name: "Survival Over Ceremony"
    description: "Patterns earn status through usage, not approval dialogs"
    implications:
      - 5+ Gold imports = canonical candidate
      - 2+ weeks stable = ready for promotion
      - Usage data over committee decisions

  - id: code-is-precedent
    name: "Code is Precedent"
    description: "Patterns that survive become canonical"
    implications:
      - No nomination PRs
      - Survival engine promotes automatically
      - 24h veto window for human oversight

  - id: physics-not-preferences
    name: "Physics, Not Preferences"
    description: "Block physics violations, not style novelty"
    implications:
      - Zone-physics mismatch = BLOCK
      - Material-timing mismatch = BLOCK
      - Style deviation = TAG (allow but track)
