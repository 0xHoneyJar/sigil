Sprint 3 COMPLETED
Theme: ESLint Plugin
Date: 2026-01-07

Engineer Review: APPROVED (All good)
Security Audit: APPROVED - LET'S FUCKING GO

All acceptance criteria met:
- [x] Plugin exports rules and configs correctly
- [x] config-loader loads .sigilrc.yaml and caches
- [x] zone-resolver maps file paths to zones via glob matching
- [x] enforce-tokens detects arbitrary values [13px]
- [x] zone-compliance checks timing against motion constraints
- [x] input-physics detects onClick without keyboard handlers
- [x] recommended config sets correct severity levels

Security checklist passed:
- [x] No path traversal vulnerabilities in config loading
- [x] Glob patterns don't enable ReDoS
- [x] No arbitrary code execution
- [x] File system access is safe (sync operations OK for lint time)
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive paths
