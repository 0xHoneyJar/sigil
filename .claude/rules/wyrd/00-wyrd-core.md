# Wyrd: Core Philosophy

Wyrd (Old English: fate, destiny) reveals truth through testing.

## The Wyrd Principle

> "What will be is what survives the test."

- **Fate emerges through testing** — Truth is revealed, not assumed
- **Rejection is data** — Each "no" teaches the system
- **Confidence calibrates** — Predictions improve with feedback
- **Reality anchors claims** — Validate against real code and tests

## When to Use /wyrd

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Check confidence before generating | `/wyrd` |
| Recalibrate after many rejections | `/wyrd calibrate` |
| Validate hypothesis against codebase | `/wyrd test` |
| Extract patterns from rejection log | `/wyrd learn` |

## Integration with Other Constructs

| Construct | Wyrd's Role |
|-----------|-------------|
| Sigil | Wyrd feeds rejection learnings → Sigil records as taste |
| Glyph | Wyrd validates hypothesis → Glyph generates with confidence |
| Rigor | Wyrd invokes Rigor during self-validation phase |

## The Five Phases

1. **Hypothesize** — Form hypothesis before generation
2. **Self-Validate** — Check output against physics + rigor
3. **Learn** — Capture rejections as training data
4. **Reality Anchor** — Validate against tests when available
5. **Community** — Anonymous telemetry (opt-in)

## The Closed Loop

```
OPEN LOOP (Anti-Pattern):
  User Request → Generate → Present → [User fixes manually] → Lost

CLOSED LOOP (Wyrd Pattern):
  User Request → Hypothesize → Generate → Self-Validate → Present →
  Capture Feedback → Learn → [Improved next time]
```

Each rejected proposal makes the system more aligned. Rejections aren't failures—they're calibration data.
