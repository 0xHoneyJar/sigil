# /zone

This command has been renamed to `/map` in Sigil v4.

Please use `/map` instead:

```
/map              # Review and update zone configuration
/map --add        # Add a new custom zone
/map --paths      # Focus on path mapping only
```

See `.claude/commands/map.md` for full documentation.
