<!-- ============================================================
     NOTES.md TEMPLATE - Required Sections for v0.16.0

     Initialize by copying this file to grimoires/loa/NOTES.md
     and replacing placeholder content with actual project data.
     ============================================================ -->

## Current Focus

<!-- Update at: session start, status change, blocker hit/resolved -->

- **Active Task**: [Task ID] - [Description]
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Blocked By**: None
- **Next Action**: [Specific next step to take]

## Session Log

<!-- Append-only - never delete entries -->
<!-- Update at: session start, significant events, session end -->

| Timestamp | Event | Outcome |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | Initialized NOTES.md | Template created |

## Decisions

<!-- Update at: decision made, architecture choice, implementation choice -->

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Decided By |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Placeholder decision] | [Rationale for decision] | [Agent or user] |

## Blockers

<!-- Use [RESOLVED] prefix when resolved -->
<!-- Update at: blocker hit, blocker resolved -->

- [ ] [Placeholder blocker] (ETA: YYYY-MM-DD)

## Technical Debt

<!-- Update at: technical debt discovered during implementation -->

| ID | Description | Severity | Found By | Sprint |
|----|-------------|----------|----------|--------|
| TD-001 | [Placeholder debt item] | MEDIUM | [agent-name] | S01 |

## Learnings

<!-- Project-specific knowledge discovered during implementation -->
<!-- Update at: mistake discovered, new insight gained -->

- [Placeholder learning - project-specific knowledge goes here]

## Session Continuity

<!-- CRITICAL: Load this section FIRST after /clear (~100 tokens) -->
<!-- See: .claude/protocols/session-continuity.md -->

### Active Context

- **Current Bead**: [bead-id] ([task description])
- **Last Checkpoint**: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
- **Reasoning State**: [Where we left off, what's next]

### Lightweight Identifiers

<!-- Absolute paths only - retrieve full content on-demand via JIT -->
<!-- REQUIRED: Use ${PROJECT_ROOT} prefix for session survival -->

| Identifier | Purpose | Last Verified |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| ${PROJECT_ROOT}/[path/to/file.ext:lines] | [Purpose description] | HH:MM:SSZ |

### Pending Questions

<!-- Carry forward across sessions -->

- [ ] [Question that needs resolution]

<!-- ============================================================
     SECTION GUIDELINES

     Current Focus:
       - Active Task: Use format "Sprint-N Task N.N - Description"
       - Status: Not Started | In Progress | Blocked | Complete
       - Blocked By: "None" or specific blocker description
       - Next Action: Single, specific, actionable step

     Session Log:
       - Timestamp: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
       - Event: Brief description of what happened
       - Outcome: Result or current state
       - NEVER delete entries - append only

     Decisions:
       - Date: ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
       - Decision: What was decided
       - Rationale: Why it was decided
       - Decided By: Agent name or "user"

     Blockers:
       - Format: - [ ] Description (ETA: YYYY-MM-DD)
       - Resolved: - [x] [RESOLVED] Description - how resolved

     Technical Debt:
       - ID: TD-NNN format
       - Severity: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
       - Found By: Agent name that discovered it
       - Sprint: SNN format

     Learnings:
       - Bullet list of project-specific knowledge
       - Include context so future sessions understand

     Session Continuity:
       - Active Context: Current task, checkpoint, reasoning state
       - Lightweight Identifiers: Absolute paths with ${PROJECT_ROOT}
       - Pending Questions: Unanswered questions to carry forward
