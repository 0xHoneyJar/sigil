## Feedback Collection

Ask the user to reflect on feel from their end user's perspective.

**The Core Question:**
> "Does this feel right for your user?"

**Prompt by craft type:**

| Craft Type | Prompt |
|------------|--------|
| Generate | "Does this feel right? Think about your user in the moment of clicking." |
| Refine | "Is this better? Does it feel like what you were going for?" |
| Configure | "Does this look right for your product's personality?" |
| Pattern | "Does this data flow feel smooth to the user?" |
| Polish | "Do these interactions feel cohesive now?" |

**Listen for layer signals:**
- "feels slow/fast" → behavioral layer (timing)
- "movement feels off" → animation layer (easing, springs)
- "looks wrong" → material layer (surface, shadow)
- "something's not quite right" → ask which layer

**Signal detection:**
- **ACCEPT**: "yes", "looks good", "perfect", moves to next task
- **MODIFY**: Describes what's off ("too slow", "needs more contrast")
- **REJECT**: "no", "wrong", "start over"

**If user says no or gives feedback:**
- Listen for what layer is off
- Ask follow-up: "What should it feel like instead?"
- Use their language to adjust — don't force physics terminology
