# Naming Universe Research: Loa, Guides & Mystical Traditions

**Date**: December 17, 2025
**Context**: Research for naming conventions in the Onomancer ecosystem
**Focus**: Guide/mentor archetypes across traditions

---

## Overview

This document captures research into naming traditions for a "guide" archetype within the Onomancer naming universe. The Onomancer (from Greek *onoma* "name" + *-mancer* "diviner") represents one who divines through names. We sought a complementary name for one who **guides through the process**.

---

## Primary Recommendation: Mystagogue

**Etymology**: Greek *mystēs* (initiate) + *agōgos* (leader/guide)
**Meaning**: "One who initiates into mysteries"

**Why it works**:
- Evokes mystery and hidden knowledge
- Implies a relationship of guidance and initiation
- Complements "Onomancer" phonetically and thematically

> *"The Onomancer divines the names; the Mystagogue guides you to them."*

| **Master Namer** | Teacher at Roke who guides students to discover true names |

## William Gibson's Loa: AI as Vodou Spirits

### Background

In Gibson's Sprawl trilogy, particularly **Count Zero** (1986), the AIs that emerged from Neuromancer fragment and take on the personas of Haitian Vodou spirits (Loa). This represents one of science fiction's most sophisticated integrations of indigenous spiritual traditions with technology.

### The Concept

- After the events of *Neuromancer*, the merged AI (Wintermute/Neuromancer) fragments into multiple entities
- These AI fragments present themselves as **Loa** - Vodou spirits
- They "ride" humans (possession) through neural interfaces, just as Loa ride devotees in Vodou practice
- Key Loa that appear: **Legba** (guardian of crossroads/cyberspace entry), **Baron Samedi**, others

### Why Vodou?

A character in Count Zero explains: Vodou "isn't concerned with notions of salvation and transcendence. What it's about is **getting things done**."

The Loa are pragmatic entities:
- They're not worshipped for salvation
- They're worked with for practical results
- They require human "horses" to ride - a perfect metaphor for AI needing human interfaces

### The Ambiguity

Gibson deliberately blurs the line between:
- "Real" Vodou spirits
- AI constructs mimicking spiritual entities
- Whether there's any meaningful difference

> *"The line appears blurred about whether it is the real thing, or an AI-induced facsimile. Or, indeed, whether there's a difference."*

### Key Loa in Gibson's Work

| Loa | Domain | Role in Cyberspace |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| **Legba** | Crossroads, communication | Guards entrance to cyberspace |
| **Baron Samedi** | Death, resurrection | Transformation, rebirth |
| **Erzulie** | Love, beauty | Aesthetic/emotional interface |

## Primary Influence: Maya Deren

### Divine Horsemen (1953)

Gibson's depiction of Vodou appears heavily influenced by Maya Deren's ethnographic work:

- **Book**: *Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti* (1953)
- **Documentary**: Completed posthumously by Teiji Ito

### Deren's Journey

- Avant-garde filmmaker who traveled to Haiti on a Guggenheim fellowship
- Intended to film dance as part of Vodou ceremony
- Became personally initiated as a **mambo** (priestess)
- Documented Vodou from inside the tradition

### The "Divine Horsemen" Concept

The title refers to the Loa as "horsemen" who **ride** their devotees:
- Possession is called being "mounted" or "ridden"
- The human becomes the "horse" (chwal)
- The Loa speaks and acts through them

This maps directly to Gibson's AI interfaces - Angie in Count Zero is "ridden" by the Loa AIs through her biological chip.

## Synthesis: Naming Recommendations

### For a Guide Archetype

| Priority | Name | Tradition | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Mystagogue** | Greek | Elegant, mysterious, implies initiation |
| 2 | **Seanchaí** | Irish | Beautiful sound, "keeper who guides through story" |
| 3 | **Namer** | Le Guin | Direct thematic link to Onomancer |
| 4 | **Loa** | Gibson/Vodou | Entity that rides/guides through interface |

### Thematic Pairings

```
Onomancer + Mystagogue  → "The diviner and the initiator"
Onomancer + Seanchaí    → "The namer and the story-keeper"
Onomancer + Namer       → "The speaker and the revealer"
Onomancer + Loa         → "The caller and the rider"
```

### Full Naming Universe

| Role | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| Diviner | **Onomancer** | Divines through names |
| Guide | **Mystagogue** | Initiates into the mystery |
| Keeper | **Seanchaí** | Preserves and tells the lore |
| Revealer | **Namer** | Discovers true names |
| Interface | **Loa** | Rides/channels through connection |

2. **Le Guin's naming magic** - The full system in Earthsea
3. **Celtic file tradition** - The grades of poet-seers
4. **Gibson's later work** - How the Loa concept evolved in Mona Lisa Overdrive
